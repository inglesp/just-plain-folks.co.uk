  <h2>More Williams babies</h2>
</div>
      <p>Priscilla Williams had already named her next baby, after the deaths of Anna Maria and Susanna, with her own name, Priscilla.  She would already have been carrying this Priscilla when her first two little daughters died.  She continued to fall pregnant every year or two, giving birth to Alexander in 1864 and Emma Jane in 1866. She now had 5 children to care for, and was still only 28.</p>
<p>After 1861 the number of deaths in the village had fallen back to something between 9 and 18 each year, with deaths among children usually less than half of the total.  The year 1868 stands out from every other in this period however, even 1861, with a total of 32 deaths, 25 of whom are under 13.  According to Joseph Humphrey, the Caister blacksmith, 1868 saw an exceptionally hot dry summer, with the harvest beginning early on 21st July. “A Mr. Colyer of Ormesby had a wheat stack up on July 24th.”  (This compares with the late harvest that he records for 1860, which did not begin until 27th August, and finish until 21st September!)  By late August 1868 the natural pleasure brought about by a successful harvest must have been evaporating however, in the face of a fear which perhaps made people want to keep their children at home, preventing them from joining in the usual agricultural activities.  The burial records show a string of deaths, one after the other, through the late summer and autumn months, with hardly an adult among them.  Six families seem to have had two or three children die, although on closer examination it turns out that some of the children were cousins rather than siblings.  Among the families which lost three children were once again the Williams family.  Priscilla (aged 6) was buried on September 4th, Emma (2) on September 10th and Alexander (5) on September 18th.</p>
<p>What was the killer?  According to her death certificate, in the case of Priscilla it was scarlatina, the usual name at that time for scarlet fever.  It seems most likely that this was the culprit in the other cases too.  Scarlet fever was responsible  for nearly 20,000 deaths in 1840 alone, and, as many school records show, it was a frequent visitor, generally in the winter months, particularly targeting young children, leaving many who survived blind or deaf.</p>

<p>The death certificate states that James was present at the death.  The horror of losing three children is such quick succession can hardly be imagined.  Now left, once again, with only the two older boys (now 12 and 10,) it seems almost a wonder that they had any appetite for having more children.  When I first saw the family bible that James and Priscilla gave to Robert Henry ‘as a birthday token’ on his 26th birthday in 1885, I wondered at the long gap between Robert’s birth and that of his next brother, born in 1870.  Now that the Internet has made it so easy to find out the existence of the children who did not survive, that gap has been explained.</p>
