  <h2>From Strood to Winterton</h2>
</div>
      <p>The move was made in March 1857.  Coastguard records from the Public Record Office at Kew show that James Williams was ‘transferred’ to Winterton from <span class="caps">HMS</span> Northern Star.  This was the boat that he and Edward had returned to England in, two and a half years earlier.  The only record that shows what James had been doing in the meantime, comes from the birth certificate of his first child.  This child, a boy named James Edward (after his father and grandfather &#8211; the obvious names!)  was born on 22nd April 1856 at Taylor’s Lane.  The mother is Priscilla Williams (‘formerly Fawcett’) and the occupation of the father is recorded as rigger in H.M. Dockyard.</p>
<p>H.M.Dockyard<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> at Chatham  lay across the Medway from Strood and was a major local employer.  Some 26 different trades were involved in the building of a wooden sailing ship.  In the late 18th century over 40 riggers were employed at the Dockyard.  A warship required about 20 miles of rope for its rigging, and this could be made well in advance in the Fitted Rigging House at the North end of the great Anchor Wharf Storehouses, which had been completed in 1805.  James would have worked with the sweet animal smell of the Russian hemp ropes in his nostrils.  When a ship was ready for rigging there might be two weeks work to finish the job, worked barefoot for safety.</p>
<p>3 days before young James Edward’s birth Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Princess Royal made a visit to the Chatham hospitals to inspect the sick and wounded from the Crimean War, which had just ended in the March of that year.  They arrived by ‘special train’ at Strood at 3.20. and left just under two hours later. (Chatham railway station was not opened until 1858.)  I wonder whether any of the family from the house in Taylors Lane, so close to the station, watched their arrival; although the Maidstone and Kentish Journal says that ‘there were but few people assembled at the station’ and that there was ‘no excitement’ along the line of the route.  The royal party inspected about 200 servicemen, each holding a card with details of their name, rank and when, where and how they had been wounded.  The newspaper account contains some individual stories, but it must have been a whistle-stop tour of duty, with their Highnesses sweeping straight past many of the patients.</p>
<p>During the Crimean War, the Coastguard was used for the first time as a reserve force for the Royal Navy.  In the year that the war ended, the Coastguard Service Act was passed, transferring control of the Coastguard to the Admiralty and giving it new responsibilities to provide for the defence of the coasts of the realm as well as to man the Royal Navy in the event of war or emergency.  During the next 40 years there was to be a new anxiety about invasion, which had lain dormant for many years after the defeat of the first Bonaparte. It was fanned from 1859, by the posturings of the new Emperor Napoleon in France, and the new era of continental rivalries that followed. So although smuggling was on the wane (as a result of the moves towards freeing trade from duties, which had gained momentum from the 1820s) the Coastguard was to gain in significance until after the First World War.  In addition to the areas specified in the Act, it would be responsible for assisting vessels in distress, taking charge of wrecks, operating life-saving apparatus, participating in the lifeboat service, searching for mines and torpedoes lost at sea and performing a range of duties in connection with signals, telegraphs, buoys, lighthouses, wild birds and sea creatures washed ashore!</p>
