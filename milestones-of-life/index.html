  <h2>Milestones of Life</h2>
</div>
      <p>At the time of the 1891 census, my great grandfather, Robert was <em>not</em> at sea.  He was now 31, and was a First Class Petty Officer in the Navy.  He, too, was now married; to Mary Love Robinson, who had been his neighbour when they were both babies, 30 years earlier.  They were only very newly married.  Their marriage certificate shows that the wedding had taken place less than 2 months before, on 10th February, in the Independent Chapel in Southwold, home to the Robinson family since 1863.  This raises the interesting possibility that the Robinsons had always been non-conformists. Certainly I can find no record of Mary’s baptism in Winterton parish church.</p>
<p>Before her marriage, aged 30, Mary had been a pupil teacher.  My grandmother told a story about how one of Mary’s several unmarried sisters had tried to woo Robert away from her, by letter, I think. Presumably this was while he was abroad on service.  Possibly some deception &#8211; unsuccessful &#8211; was practised, but I can’t remember the details. The young couple were now living in Portsea, Portsmouth, and 2 years later my grandfather, Robert George, would be born to them.</p>
<p>Another interesting artefact has survived in the family.  In October 1885, a month after James and Priscilla had given Robert a large family bible for his birthday, Mary Robinson had been given a book called ‘The Milestones of Life’ written by Rev. A.F. Thomson, B.A.  It is inscribed: ‘A birthday gift from her loving Father and Mother.’ Had the two now become engaged?  or were the gifts a hint?  Mary’s little volume gives many interesting insight into the attitudes and aspirations of the time, and also reflects how foreign most of these are to us, today.</p>
<p>The contrast between the roles of men and women is emphasised: <strong>‘Look around you, and in almost every family you know you will find some youth or some girl preparing, each after their several fashions &#8211; the boy in the way of a business or profession, the girl by the apparently more royal road of marriage &#8211; to launch out on the vast, and, to them unknown and trackless ocean of the world.’</strong> <em>(appropriate, that, for a boy who had made his career in the navy&#8230;)</em>  There is a huge emphasis on the sanctity of the home, and the woman’s responsibility for its creation.  Even the word ‘home’ is sometimes dignified with a capital ‘H’ and  italics, as in the passage that declares  <strong>‘We are not writing of love, but of marriage, of <em>Home</em>!  How much is conveyed in this dear monosyllable! With <em>him</em> she is to build up a Home &#8211; the true shrine of love, the bright tenement, however lowly, of the clearest and purest flame of mutual affection that is, or ever can be, known to man or woman.’</strong>  It is hard not to see a plot to keep girls, who were probably rather better educated than many of their mothers, in an unquestioning and docile role, bought off with the idea that they were fulfilling as high a calling in the domestic sphere, as their menfolk who were concentrating their strengths and talents on the world outside the home, creating wealth and building an empire.  Take this, for example: <strong>‘the fact is, the better the woman the more passive is her character.  She must be sought, not seek.  No surer sign exists of a want of feminine virtue, than when a woman anticipates the action of a man&#8230;’</strong>  /(Mary’s jealous sister obviously hadn’t read, or taken notice, of this bit!)/  Women have <strong>‘prejudices’</strong> <strong>‘generally transmitted to her by her family’</strong> rather than <strong>‘convictions’</strong> which are a male preserve. I have looked in vain in this little volume for any real advice, as we would see it, about how to achieve happy, loving relationships!</p>
<p>If it seems sad that the children of such large families, from such lively, self-sufficient communities, should have needed advice about how to choose a marriage partner, it seems even more sad, but for a different reason, that the very next chapter should have as its subject <strong>‘Our First Sore Grief’</strong>, in other words the probable early loss of a child of the new marriage. Yet as we have seen, the death of children was an occurrence that few families seem to have escaped. <strong>‘How small a span of time converts the bride into the mother!  What an instant, as it were, passes before that mother may, like Rachael, “weep for her children, because they are not!”’</strong>   This time the advice offered seems more grounded in good common sense however.  <strong>‘Let no one&#8230; blame himself for any access of natural sorrow&#8230;.(it) is perhaps positively necessary to our bodily and spiritual health.’</strong>  In the end, however, there is ‘no real consolation in such a trial, apart from ministering the same to others, and thus establishing a sympathetic union of grief, thereby generalising and so diminishing its force.’  I am not aware that  Robert and Mary saw the death of any of their young children, although in common with others of their siblings, they seem to have had much smaller families than their parents &#8211; in their case a son, Robert, born in 1893, and a daughter, Rose, born a few years later.</p>
