  <h2>Tragedy strikes</h2>
</div>
      <p>It must certainly have been an <em>even</em> greater blessing at the time when tragedy first struck the family, at the end of 1861.  Looking at the figures for deaths in the village<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup>, they usually ranged between 10 and 20 each year, excluding shipwrecked mariners and ‘bodies on beach.’  In both 1860 and 1861 however, the figures are just above the top end of this normal range, and the proportion of deaths to children under 13 is rather higher than the usual average of around 50%.  In 1860 there are 22 deaths, 14 under 13 years old.  In 1861 there are 21, of whom 12 are under 13.  Perhaps this is not conclusive proof of an epidemic at work, and it would be expensive to obtain every death certificate to look for a pattern. There were after all many killer diseases at large among the rapidly growing population of the mid-century, and they could strike anywhere, even where provision of clean water and good sanitation could be expected to be better than the norm.  In the month of December 1861 Queen Victoria lost her beloved husband Prince Albert to typhoid fever! But to return to Winterton, there are only two deaths among the children who live in the coastguard yard, and they both take place in that same month of December 1861. Both are from the Williams family. Susanna was buried on the 3rd December aged 8 months, and Anna Maria was buried on 11th December, aged 3 years and 8 months.  Priscilla and James were left with their two young boys.</p>
