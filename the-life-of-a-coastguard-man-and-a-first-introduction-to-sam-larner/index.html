  <h2>The life of a coastguard man - and a first introduction to Sam Larner </h2>
</div>
      <p>The shoreline was a busy place and whales were not the only creatures to be washed ashore.  In the course of 1857, 6 ‘shipwrecked mariners’ are listed among the 20 burials in the church.  No names are recorded, either of individuals or of the ships they came from. It is possible that they were from the crew of the Zillah, a Whitby collier brig that came ashore at two o’clock one morning in an October gale<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup>. Three of the local coastguard struggled to fire rockets and mortar lines, but all went wide of the mark or broke, and it was a boat launched from the beach that eventually rescued the three survivors.  In the following 2 years another 3 shipwrecked mariners were buried, and in 1860 a ‘body found on beach’.  And not all who died by drowning remained anonymous.  There is a tombstone in the churchyard which records the death of George Flaxman (another local name) ‘who was drowned at sea during the May Gale 1860, aged 28 years.’  A Caister blacksmith called Joseph Humphrey kept a diary at this period which has survived<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup>.  He records that 12 ‘mackrell boats’ were lost in the gales of Whit Monday that year, ‘with all hands’, as well as boats from Sheringham and Lowestoft.  Perhaps George Flaxman was on one of these.</p>
<p>Another local casualty of that May Gale was apparently Edward Powles<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup>, the grandfather of Sam Larner, born in 1878.  I need to introduce Sam Larner into this account, because his memories (recorded in 1960), provide one of the most vivid pictures of 19th century Winterton now available.  He was ‘discovered’ by Charles Parker, Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger while they were collecting material for their ground-breaking ‘Radio Ballads’, one of which was about North Sea herring fishermen.  They recorded many hours of his singing and his reminiscences, and these may still be listened to in the Charles Parker Archive in Birmingham. Sam’s first memory, as a 5 or 6-year-old boy, was of 4 sailors washed ashore on the beach, whose bodies were laid in the Church barn, which was used for a mortuary.  Sam and his friends accidentally found them while they were bird-nesting.  He also tells the earlier story of how his grandmother knew of his grandfather’s drowning, some years before he was born, because “She see him in a vision as she laid in bed.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, then, one of the main activities of the coastguard service seems to have been to practice techniques that would cut down the woeful loss of life from shipwrecked vessels. The sandbanks off shore along this stretch of coast, added hugely to the high number of boats that came to grief within sight of land all around Britain, and there had been much progress in carrying out ship to shore rescue since the late eighteenth century. We have already seen how the coastguards tried to help the Zillah in 1857.  A number of pioneers had devised methods of sending a line over a ship in difficulty, so that a rescue boat could be hauled out, or passengers swung to shore in some kind of sling or cradle.  In the end the most successful methods employed a rocket, but for many years the most widely used technique was the one devised by George Manby, a Norfolk man, whose mortar apparatus fired a line, and was thus known as the Manby Mortar<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Manby was spurred on by a tragedy he had witnessed in Yarmouth in 1807. The Snipe, a ship at anchor carrying French prisoners captured in the Napoleonic Wars, (including many women and children,) became entangled with a merchant vessel in a terrible storm. She was forced to cut her anchor to get free, and thus drifted until she came aground near the pier and began to break up.  Helpless onlookers watched and heard as those on board were washed away and drowned.</p>
<p>Manby’s mortar was probably first used with success in Yarmouth, and it caught on most widely round the East Anglian coast.  By the time of his death in 1854 Manby could claim that this and other of his inventions had saved a thousand lives.</p>

<p>A sepia photo hangs in the shadows at the back of the parish church in Winterton, which shows the local coastguards posing stiffly with their rescue equipment.  In a rough field in the foreground, a rocket or mortar is mounted on a tripod. 5 men dressed in sailors’ uniform are facing the camera, one holds the end of a coiled rope, another wears a cork lifejacket. An older-looking man, with a beard that makes him look a bit like George V, wears a jacket and white cap.  He must be in charge, one of the successors of John Bungard.  Behind the group is a bramble hedge beyond which a hotchpotch of cottages and the tower of Holy Trinity and All Saints can be seen.  This equipment was obviously heavy.  It was carried to the point on the coast where it was needed, on its own rocket-cart.  In the memoir of Ellenor Starling<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup>,  her daughter records how Ellenor’s Father, the miller Austic Starling, was called one night in the 1930s to provide the horses to pull it, no doubt a system which had been in operation for many years. Another photo of the same group of coastguards shows them posed outside the rocket shed, near Kings Corner (still there today, but now a garage!)</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn17"><sup>17</sup> <em>Diary of Joseph Humphrey, blacksmith of Caister</em> is held at the Norfolk Record Office, catalogue reference  MC 1193/1, 807XB.  William White also testifies to the severity of the May 1860 gale in his <em>History gazetteer of Norfolk 1864</em>, p.341: ‘On the 28th May 1860, there was a terrific gale on the eastern coast of the kingdom, which swept 194 men in the prime of life into eternity, leaving 80 widows and 191 children bereft of their support and entailing a loss of 21 fine boats on the shipping interest of this borough (i.e.Yarmouth.)  About £10,400 were contributed by the benevolent for the relief of the families of the drowned, and this sum is invested in the 3% consols and the interest doled out to the widows and children of those who perished.’</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn18"><sup>18</sup> I say probably, because I believe Sam Larner’s other grandfather was called George and did not die until 1895.  There are no more children born to Sam’s mother’s father, Edward, aged 40 or 41, after 1860, however.  The fact that there is no record of his burial must presumably be due to the lack of a body.  What is slightly confusing is that Sam refers to this grandfather as &#8216;Bob&#8217;.  But as he himself says elsewhere, “We all went for nicknames here.”  His own father was also called George, but was known to everyone as &#8216;Bradley&#8217;, and according to Alan Utting Sam&#8217;s own nickname was &#8216;Funky&#8217;!</p>
