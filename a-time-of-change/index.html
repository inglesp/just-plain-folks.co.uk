  <h2>A time of change</h2>
</div>
      <p>The second half of the 1870s saw some important changes in Winterton.  The Primitive Methodists, who had founded a church in Winterton in 1843, built a fine new chapel in the Market Place in 1876.  It had seating for 250.  A School Board was set up in 1875 to provide schools for the children of Winterton and East and West Somerton.  The law now said that School Boards were to ensure that there were school places for every child in the country, and in 1877 an infants’ room was added to the National School which had been built in Winterton in 1845, providing accommodation for another 100 children.  That same year the railway from Martham and Hemsby to Great Yarmouth opened, and major restoration work to the parish church began.</p>
<p>Winterton had been fortunate in receiving much patronage from the Hume family over the years.  Joseph Hume<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>, son of a Scottish fisherman, was the MP for the Scottish seat of Montrose Burghs, and was famous as a maverick radical, who harried successive Chancellors of the Exchequer as a self-appointed watchdog of the public purse. Later he championed the cause of household suffrage. Until his death in 1855, he had lived at Burnley Hall in East Somerton, (an older house which he renamed after his wife’s family. They had made a fortune through the East India Company, which helped finance Joseph’s political career as well as his generosity to the people of Winterton.)  He had given the land for the original school building in 1845, and had been instrumental in getting a buoy placed on Winterton Ness<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup>.  He had several sons including Joseph Burnley Hume and William Burnley Hume, and William married Eliza, the daughter of the Revd. John Nelson, who was Rector of Winterton between 1821 and 1867. William and his wife lived in Hill House in Winterton itself, and continued the family tradition of local philanthropy. William presented the beachmen of Winterton with their own private lifeboat – the Minnie Hume – after apparently persuading the 2 rival companies to amalgamate in 1868<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When William Hume died in 1876, his widow offered to pay for the complete restoration of the Parish Church of Holy Trinity and All Saints in his memory.</p>
<p>A report on the state of the church<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> condemned many features of the mediaeval building.  Windows in the nave “are filled in with wretched wood frames and very miscellaneous glazing”, the plasterwork is “generally of an uneven and unsatisfactory character”, the walls suffer from “excessive dampness” caused by the build-up of soil outside the walls, and the bells “are in a sadly neglected condition&#8230;.the timbers being very decayed&#8230; two of the bells being broken, one of which rests in a rather dangerous position and might before long fall through the floor.”  The report contains recommendations which are very much in accordance with contemporary ideas about increasing the dignity of worship; ideas such as putting in a screen between the nave and the chancel. There are also ideas that have a timeless ring: “The question of heating the Church is one that requires to be mentioned as there is no doubt it would add materially to the comfort of the congregation during the winter months&#8230;..(but) the cost of an efficient heating apparatus must of necessity be considerable”!</p>
<p>The extent of the restoration and the celebrations that followed their completion in 1878, are fully described in the guidebook on sale in the church<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup>.  The speed of the work seems remarkable in a later age used to raising money for church building schemes bit by bit and with a lot of effort from individuals over a long period of time!  When the Church was reopened in July 1878 Mrs Hume opened Hill House, its greenhouses and ferneries to the public and held a bazaar in the grounds. I have a fanciful picture in my mind of Edward Fawcett searching through the glasshouses for specimens of plants he had seen being ‘collected’ while he was ‘ashore botanising’ with Robert McCormick in the 1840s! I have a feeling he would have been quick to claim a share in the glory too!</p>
<p>The last innovation in the 1870s was Winterton’s first post office set up in 1879 in Beach Road, but changes would continue apace as communities such as Winterton became less isolated and less self-sufficient.  As for the Williams family, the 1870s was the decade in which Edward Fawcett’s wife Susannah died and his two oldest grandsons left school.  I can write with confidence that both James and Robert attended school, for in the 1871 census  James is recorded as a pupil teacher (aged 14), Robert as a scholar (aged 11)  Whatever their parents’ ambitions for them may, or may not, have been however, it looks as though the call of the sea was too strong to resist.  In 1874 James joined the Provident Friendly Society, paying a shilling and sixpence each month, but withdrawing the following year for the enigmatic reason that he was ‘at sea.’  In the same year, Robert joined the navy, where he was to serve for many years to come.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn26"><sup>26</sup> The report is now in the Norfolk Record Office, catalogue reference DN/<span class="caps">DPL</span> 2/11/408.  Another reference to the decayed state of the church appears in a book published about the area in 1866: <em>Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft</em> by J G Nall.  He says: ‘Weeds are growing in the crevices of the tower, and its only remaining floor is rotten.  A colony of jackdaws have taken possession of it, and the stone steps leading to the summit are covered with their nests.’  (But, while on this subject, there were still jackdaws disappearing into holes in the tower when I last visited!)</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn27"><sup>27</sup> The history and guide book recently revised by Fr Adrian Ling contains much of the information contained in my older version, produced by Roy Tricker, but is much easier to read, with some good new photos!</p>
