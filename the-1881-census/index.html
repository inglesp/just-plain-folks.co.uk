  <h2>The 1881 census</h2>
</div>
      <p>Every 10 years the census enumerators went to work to record every member of the burgeoning population, in the process creating a snapshot of each family in the land and its occupations on one particular Sunday night in the early spring.  In the process they preserved many events for us that would otherwise be lost to view.</p>
<p>The census for 1881 was taken on the night of April 3/4.  We find that Edward Fawcett, widower, is now living in the Barrack Yard as part of the Williams household.  The five children born since 1870 are at home, the youngest, Alfred being just one month old.  Robert, meanwhile, is a boarder at the “Golden Lion,” Church Street in Portsea, Hampshire.  There is another lodger there, who is also a Seaman RN, as is the oldest son of the family.  All 3 are aged 21 or 22. James, on the other hand, is nearer home. He is on board ship, as ‘Forth Hand’ in Yarmouth.  He is 25, and he, shockingly, is also described as a widower! The Master of the boat &#8211; the Holmsdale &#8211; is 20 year-old John George, born in Winterton.  Some hunting around in the birth, marriage and death registers reveals that James had married Sarah Eliza George, from one of the fishing families in Winterton.  She had been buried in Winterton churchyard, at the beginning of the previous December, aged 26.  The inescapable conclusion is that she had died in, or shortly after, childbirth, as the census reveals a 5 month-old baby living in the George household in Black Street, Winterton, who is a ‘grandson.’ He had been baptised with his Father’s names, James Edward, at the beginning of January, but was buried at the end of April, less than three weeks after the census took place. How hard for Priscilla, who was expecting her own final baby during these winter months; a baby who was briefly uncle to the slightly older James Edward.</p>
