  <h2>Priscilla Williams...</h2>
</div>
      <p>Priscilla’s background is also less than straightforward.  The marriage certificate calls her Priscilla Fawcett Johnson.  The column for Father’s name and surname is left blank, although Edward Fawcett’s name is there as a witness to the wedding.  So Priscilla Fawcett is perhaps illegitimate and Edward Fawcett only her adopted father!  This means that the smiling old man in the oil painting is not my three greats grandfather after all!  Well, not in the genetic sense.  But in every other way my forebears were clearly his descendants, as the painting gives eloquent testimony, and when he came to live in the coastguard cottage in Winterton, the census enumerator listed him clearly as Father-in-law to James.</p>
<p>In the baptism registers for Strood there are several illegitimate children born to mothers of the name of Johnson &#8211; 4 between 1823 and 1838 in fact, although the name is not otherwise especially common there.  The mothers are all apparently different, although one is Susanna without an h, and another is Susannah, with.  Susannah Johnson had a daughter called Priscilla baptised on March 4th 1838 and all the available evidence is that this is the future Priscilla Williams.  There is no date of birth, and at first I thought that this baby must have been a  year or two old before she was christened, if only because an 1838 birth date pushes Priscilla’s age back to 16 at the time of her marriage.  I had not yet looked for her in the public records of the General Registry Office, as the compulsory registration of births, marriages and deaths was only introduced in the autumn of 1837.  But a search quickly revealed the birth of Priscilla Johnson in the spring of 1838, and the marriage of Edward Fawcett to Susannah Johnson a year later!  So either Edward was the little girl’s father, and married her mother a year after her birth, a matter of months before his first long polar voyage, or else he was not, which could explain the empty column on Priscilla’s wedding certificate.  I would like to think that perhaps a legalistic cleric refused to record Edward Fawcett as the little girl’s father, despite assurances to the contrary, for no other reason than that her parents had not been married at the time of her birth. After all Edward could have been away at sea at the time Susannah’s pregnancy was discovered, and the baby born. But there is no way of knowing!  Edward was 26 by the time he actually married Susannah and she was apparently 20.  I can find no other Fawcett babies by Edward and Susannah in the records, which seems surprising, even despite his long absences at sea. Surely he must have loved his wife’s little daughter, who had become his own, and longed to see how she had grown when he returned!</p>
<p>And so Priscilla was only 16 years and about 8 months towards her 17th birthday when she got married to a man more than twice her age, scarred no doubt by his experiences in the Arctic!  What would he talk to his new young wife about?  The first definite news of Franklin’s fate had now come to light, and the horrific revelation from Inuit informers, that some of his crew had resorted to cannibalism as the last survivors clung to life.  In December 1854 Charles Dickens’ Household Words<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> weighed into the debate about whether the word of ‘uncivilised people with a domesticity of blood and blubber’ should be trusted. Did the little family in Taylors Lane read this periodical and discuss the merits of the case?  A parliamentary committee chewed over the question of whether McClure and his crew merited the prize money offered for the first discoverers of a North-West passage and decided that they did<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup>.  How did Edward and James spend their share?  Medals were issued, although both men had theirs sent rather than receiving them in person<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>.  Were they trying to put the past behind them, or was it sometimes easier to live in the close and perhaps exclusive camaraderie of old shipmates?  So many questions will never be answered, but all the signs for James and Priscilla are of a long and stable family life, which did not come to an end until James died in 1901.  In the meantime they would have at least 13 children, of whom 7 would survive, and they would move from Kent to Norfolk, where James would be a coastguard until his retirement.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn9"><sup>9</sup> Lady Jane Franklin used all her influence to insist that her late husband had been the first to discover the North West Passage, but a Select Committee of Parliament accepted that McClure and his men were “the first who have passed by water from sea to sea and have returned to this country a living evidence of the existence of a NW Passage.” Of course part of their ‘passage’ had been on foot over the ice between the Investigator and the Resolute.</p>
