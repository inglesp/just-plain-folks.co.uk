  <h2>A second family...</h2>
</div>
      <p>After an unusually long gap of 4 years between births however, Priscilla was soon pregnant once again.  And during the 1870s and very beginning of the 1880s, she was to have another 6 children, another family almost.  This time only one of the children was to perish as an infant, the rest surviving until adulthood.  Edwin Ernest was born at the end of 1870 (and christened on Christmas Day), another Alexander was born 18 months later, but only survived a month.  Two girls were born in 1873 and 1875 named Mary Bell and Ellen Maria. Another baby boy was born in 1878, the same year as Sam Larner, and was named Edward Fawcett Williams.  A final little boy was born some time at the beginning of 1881 named Alfred Evelyn.  His mother was 42, or perhaps 43 (she claims in the census of that year to be 44) and his father 61. By this time there were once again 5 children living in the Barrack Yard (as it was now called) for by now James Edward and Robert Henry had left home. 5 children under 10 sounds quite a handful for parents in their 40s and 60s, far from the first flush of youth!</p>
