  <h2>Enter the Fawcetts again...</h2>
</div>
      <p>By a remarkable coincidence, as a result of Sam’s memory of his grandfather’s death, he began reminiscing into the tape recorder about a man whom he calls ‘Ned Fawcett’.  (I had long suspected that Edward and James would have been known either as Ned and Jim, or indeed by some other nickname. This Ned had had a remarkable escape from the boat on which Sam’s grandfather died: “lost and all hands.”  So it seems that Edward Fawcett had returned to his Father’s trade as a fisherman, learnt on the Medway almost 40 years earlier, but that 2 or 3 trips “done for him”, and he had to be put ashore on the beach in a small boat.  The May Gale had struck that very night.</p>
<p>By 1860 then, Priscilla’s parents had moved up from Kent.  They were to spend the rest of their days in Winterton, lending strength to the belief that they had no other children.  By the time of the 1861 census they were living at 2 Providence Row, but I can push back their arrival to at least the previous May, on account of Sam Larner’s story of  that lucky escape in the May Gales.  A month later, at the end of June, Edward Fawcett joined the Winterton Provident Friendly Society<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This had been formed in 1857 with 32 founder members, and Edward Fawcett became number 56.  Known as “the Club” it was a typical example of the kind of self-help society that flourished in this period, protecting its members from financial disaster if they fell on hard times. It was an age when the state provided little beyond the workhouse and a pauper’s grave.   Members were mainly fishermen, and it made weekly sick payments, or in the case of death, a contribution towards their burial “to assist them or their wives to their last resting place in a respectable manner.”  Members paid 2 shillings a month, and sick pay was 10 shillings. It would seem at that rate, that the society could not afford its members to be ill very often! As a check on malingerers, those “on the club” were expected to be indoors at dusk and remain inside until daylight.  If they were observed breaking this curfew and were reported to the committee they faced possible expulsion or being ‘sent to Coventry’.  Fines were imposed on those who failed to pay their subscriptions or attend meetings.</p>
<p>There is no record of Edward Fawcett leaving the Friendly Society, although it seems unlikely that he made many more fishing trips.  Perhaps his payment of his dues was as much a thank offering for his own safety, as an insurance against disaster. It must surely have been a great blessing to James and Priscilla to have parents on hand in the next few years.  Anna Maria was born during their first year in Winterton, followed by Robert Henry about 18 months later, and Susanna another 18 months after that, in the spring of 1861. They must have provided plenty of work for grandparents to do!  Following a common pattern in naming children, I had wondered if Anna Maria might have been the name of James’ own mother. It turns out that I may have been half right, as I now believe she may have been named Mary Ann – from a New Brunswick family!  Susanna was certainly the name of Priscilla’s mother.  Priscilla herself was now 23 years old and a mother of 4 children under 5.</p>
