  <h2>End of an era</h2>
</div>
      <p>This young Robert was my grandfather, and the baby painted on his great grandfather’s knee<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup>.  Some months after this Edward Fawcett penned his letter to the Standard<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup>, and then in 1897, aged 84, he died. It will always seem remarkable to me that a man of such humble origins, should have left so many records of his life scattered across the country.  He still smiles out from his painting, with big watchful brown eyes under bushy eyebrows, and a white ‘chinstrap’ beard. He is wearing a round black sealskin hat, of the type that the older fishermen often wore for ‘best’ before flat caps became the order of the day<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup>.  Only one photograph of him survives, as far as I know, and this shows him standing, with sand dunes as a backdrop, next to his son-in-law James, using two sticks to support himself.  He looks, indeed, “a little shaky” on his “pins,” but bright and alert nonetheless.  He was buried in Winterton churchyard, but the tombstone does not survive. Joseph Hooker, only 4 years younger, lived on until 1911 so presumably was the last survivor of Sir James Ross’s Antarctic Expedition of 1839!  He may even have lived long enough to have known of Scott’s expedition to find the South Pole, although not of its tragic outcome.</p>

<p>James Williams died 4 years after his Father-in-law, in January 1901, the same month as the old Queen, who had also been 81. Like many others, Priscilla had lived her entire life in the reign of Victoria. To be widowed, and to find a <em>King</em> on the throne, must have made the new century seem like very new territory to all such as her. Two months later, when the census enumerators came calling once again, Priscilla was staying in London, with her third son, Edwin, now a police constable. He lived in Hampstead High Street with his Norfolk-born wife, Harriet, their two children: Ernest James, aged 7, and Lily J, aged 5, and a couple of lodgers; young men in their twenties, a butcher’s assistant, and a postman auxiliary.</p>
<p>I doubt if Priscilla had made a permanent move to London. Her oldest daughter, Mary, now 27, was married to a Winterton man (Arthur Todd, a cowman at Becks Farm) and had a month-old baby, Lily Gertrude.  The only photo which I have of Priscilla, shows her as a small round figure in a long black skirt, suggesting many petticoats beneath.  On the back it says ‘For a Happy Christmas with love from Mother 1908’.  The background to the photo shows a brick and cobbled wall, characteristic of  the cottages on the North Norfolk coast.</p>

<p>Priscilla lived until 1913, and shares a tombstone in the churchyard with James. In common with many others, it has an anchor carved above the details of those buried beneath.</p>

<p>To return to 1901, Mary is the only child of James and Priscilla to be living at the time in Winterton. Her eldest brother James was now a dock police fireman living in the East End of London. Unsurprisingly, there seems to have been quite a drift to the rapidly expanding capital, and not only James and Edwin, but their younger brother Edward and sister Ellen (confusingly known as Lily) now lived there. Edward was a warehouseman, and Lily was in service as a domestic housemaid in a college in Hampstead. Shortly afterwards she, at least, must have returned to Winterton, for in September 1902 her first daughter, Lotta Susaline was baptised.  The Father was Ted Rump, a ploughman from Becks Farm, where Mary’s husband worked.  Over the next few years a number of Todd and Rump babies were baptised. Mary, Lily and their husbands all lived to ripe old ages, and were buried in the church in the 1950s. Arthur Todd had been church warden at Holy Trinity and All Saints for over 20 years. As a tiny baby I was laid in Mary’s lap, the only one of James and Priscilla’s family that I can claim to have met.</p>
<p>Winterton at the turn of the century was continuing to change and develop fast. It was the heyday of the fishing industry.  Yarmouth Harbour was so full you could walk across it over the boats. In 1899 Sam Larner went on his first steam drifter, the Lottie.  There were only 8 or 9 going out of Yarmouth at first, so he considered it an honour to be working on one.  They didn’t need to be towed out, and could come and go into harbour when they liked. They were much easier to manage, using sail only to help the engine along; They could do 2 trips where a sailing boat could do one, and so they made their crew money the like of which they had never seen before.  At first Sam was kept awake at night by the noise of the engine throbbing, but in time he got used to it, and the boats were warmer and more comfortable.</p>
<p>By this time Sam was courting.  He met his future wife, Dorcas, who was a maid from Hill House, when she was sitting on the beach writing a letter.  They went to church together, went “step dancing” at socials (often organised by the church,) and went to the theatre at Yarmouth when she had a day off. Young girls in service were often not allowed out after tea, and Mrs Eliza Hume, now 81 years old, locked her doors at 9.00. But there were ways and means&#8230; Sam describes the rivalry between himself and Henry Goffin, a carter, as they tried to find opportunities to meet up with Dorcas in the evenings. At one stage Dorcas left Winterton ‘in a huff’, and so Sam followed her to London ‘to fish (her) out.’  He even joined the London fire brigade for a time, but was soon back in Norfolk, where he and Dorcas were married in 1903 and spent the rest of their days.</p>

<p>Only the youngest member of the Williams family disappears from view at the time of the 1901 census, and almost for good. If it wasn’t for his gravestone in Winterton churchyard, I would have had no knowledge for many years of what became of Alfred Evelyn. But he had evidently inherited the wandering genes of his forebears, not to mention the tradition of donning a uniform, for the inscription here reads ‘Alfred Evelyn Williams, Officer, Bombay Fire Brigade, India and the beloved husband of Birdie Williams’. Above this there is a magnificent carving of a fireman’s helmet but no more information.  All I had to go on for a long time, was a memory from my grandmother which must date from some time after her marriage to my grandfather in 1917.  She once mentioned an unhappy Indian lady called Birdie, who lived in Winterton, but she told me no more about her and at the time I didn’t know that she was part of the family. I wish I knew more of her story!  Quite recently, another Williams descendant I have been put in touch with, has told me that Alfred did indeed return to Winterton, to die shortly after the First World War of TB or something similar, at his sister Mary’s house.  No wonder his widow, Birdie, was sad. She soon returned to India with their son, Thomas.  Alfred was not the only son of Winterton to have travelled to India at this time.  Allan Octavian Hume, another son of Joseph Hume, went into the Indian Civil Service and eventually was one of the co-founders of the Indian National Congress, following in the radical tradition of his family.</p>

<p>Alfred’s tombstone is right next to that of my great grandfather, Robert Henry.  He retired from the navy and eventually moved to Caister<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup>, where there was already a considerable population of ‘ex-pat’ Winterton families, who had migrated over the years to swell the ranks of the Caister Beach Company.  He died in 1915, while his only son was fighting in the First World War.  A copy of the Flegg Magazine says</p>
<p><strong>‘Robert Henry Williams, whose body we laid to rest in the churchyard on February 15th, was one whom it was a privilege and a joy to know.  Duty, obedience, conscience, God, were great words and full of meaning and controlling forces for him&#8230;.His long record of service and character in the Navy is delightful reading and one to be proud of&#8230;.Wherever he went he commanded great respect, and from those of us who knew him well, he won unstinted affection.  He was a good man and true, and one of whom we felt quite sure.  We sympathise greatly with his widow and children and other relatives, who will sorely miss him.’</strong></p>
<p>His son survived right the way through the First World War, although the effects of shellshock probably remained with him all through his life; and he would not let <em>my</em> Father join the boy scouts, because he did not want to see him in uniform. But of course my Father’s generation were to have no choice but to wear a uniform, for the Second World War would break out when they were young men.  Among the records that my grandparents owned, in the inter-war period, when wind-up gramophones were still a novelty, and the disks to play on them few,  was one which seems to me to sum up the ‘ordinariness’ but ‘specialness’ of my family in the century I have recorded.  As a child I thought it embarrassingly quaint and hilarious, but I have come to see that it is trying to express something important!  The words go like this:</p>
<center>
<p>Just plain folks, just plain folks<br />
Take me back where I can find<br />
People of my Mother’s kind,<br />
Just plain folks, God gave them hearts of oak,<br />
Humble of birth, yet the salt of the earth,<br />
Are just plain folk.</p>
</center>

<p class="footnote" id="fn28"><sup>28</sup> The painting is unsigned and its author remains a mystery to date.  It seems that a number of artists stayed and worked in Winterton in the early 1890s, some of them based at Burnley Hall.  The most famous was Frederick Morgan, responsible for one of the well-known Pears soap ads.  He liked painting idealised ‘peasant’ scenes. And among them are a number which feature old sailors.  He rented a studio at the rear of the Three Mariners for a time.  He also specialised in cherubic babies, but young Robert George Williams is not painted in his style at all!  I am grateful to Patricia Wills-Jones for making me aware of Fred. Morgan.  She was luckier&#8230;he painted her grandfather, William King, with his brothers and sisters, and the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in around 1894.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn29"><sup>29</sup> The Standard was a national paper, which had gained a reputation for its detailed foreign news in the 1860s with its reporting of the American Civil War and the Prussian Wars against Austria and France.  (Its sister publication, the Evening Standard, was the ancestor of the London paper of that name today.)  In 1895 it cost 1d and had 10 pages.  During the last week of July it covered the Sixth International Geographical Congress, held at the Imperial Institute, with many column inches.  Two of the main topics under consideration were the development of colonial Africa (exploitation would probably be a better word) and the idea of renewing the exploration of the Antarctic.  The report of proceedings on Tuesday July 30th says <strong>“Sir Joseph Hooker, who was introduced by the Chairman as the only survivor of Sir James Ross’s Expedition, said he was heart and soul in favour of fresh Explorations, and only wished that he could join it bodily; but he was afraid that his application for employment would not be received favourably by the Admiralty (laughter).”</strong>  Can Edward Fawcett really have believed that the Chairman knew whether all those who had sailed with Ross were dead?  I doubt it, but it was a wonderful excuse to write with his own story.  His letter, published 3 days later, looks completely insignificant nestling at the bottom of page 5.  There was no letters page, and correspondence to the Editor was inserted randomly among other items, wherever there was a space.  Many are like Edward Fawcett’s, a little tetchy in tone, taking the Editor to task for an error or oversight. Others give vent to such bright ideas as issuing bicycles with registration plates, like those recently introduced for the motor car.</p>
