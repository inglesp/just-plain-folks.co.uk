<p>No one would expect it to be easy to piece together the lives of all the ordinary Neds, Jims and Bobs who ever lived&#8230; even only a century and a half ago. When I began to research my Norfolk family history, I did not expect it to be easy, especially as I was starting with common surnames like Williams and Robinson. But I was given a great deal of assistance by the fact that the baptism, marriage and death records for the Flegg parishes have been transcribed and are freely available to all on the internet, so I would like to express my gratitude here to all those who undertook this labour.</p>
<p>Once the ‘bare facts’ of birth, marriage and death have been established, however, and a few extra details such as occupations, siblings and addresses gleaned from the census, finding out more might be likened to hunting in a haystack in case anyone has dropped the proverbial needle there.  I have been extraordinarily lucky, as this story reveals.</p>
<p>I am also therefore enormously grateful for the wonderful archives that we have in this country, again freely available to all who have the time to explore them.  I have spent many happy hours in the National Archives Kew, the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, The Medway Archives and Local Studies Centre, the Norfolk Record Office and the Birmingham City Archives.  In all these places I have been given all the help I needed to get started and to retrieve the records I was looking for, as well as some useful suggestions about where else to look.</p>
<p>Through the network of genealogists who now use the Internet, I have traced a number of ‘lost cousins’ far and near.  I am especially grateful to Barbara Estabrook, possibly a fifth cousin.  The jury is still out over whether or not we are both descended from the same New Brunswick Williams line, but through her I made contact with Harry Macdonald, and through him, with Alan Utting and his sister Molly Fountain, who are only second cousins once removed!  They gave me a copy of the photo of James Williams and Edward Fawcett, and of the polar medal, as well as the benefit of the family memories and traditions that had been handed down to them.</p>
<p>On my frequent forays back to the Norfolk coast, where I spent many happy childhood hours, I have enjoyed talking to Alan McMurchie from Coastwatch in Winterton.  He is a mine of information, and generously let me have copies of some of the pictures about the area that he has acquired.  Peter Stibbons from Poppyland Press expressed a willingness to publish it, and has helped me to sort out, among other things, some of the illustrations. But in the end my impatience to get my story out led to the decision to set it free on the internet. <br />
I have also been given a lot of encouragement, suggestions and advice by close family and friends, especially Pat Williams, Richard, Peter and Helen Inglesby, Susanne Garnett and Rozina Visram.  I am deeply grateful to them all for being willing to share the excitement, as each new source of information fell into my hands! I am especially grateful to Peter for helping me to set up these web pages.</p>
<p>While my manuscript languished in the intray at Poppyland, David Higgins published ‘The Winterton Story’(July 2009).  I have resisted the temptation to add or subtract anything here in the light of his account. He covers the whole community whereas my story is centred round a family of ‘incomers’.  I was not at all surprised to find Edward Fawcett in his index however, and a new reference to pursue, this time in the Yarmouth Independent. Thank you David!</p>
