  <h2>Enter James Williams...</h2>
</div>
      <p>All three voyages mentioned by Edward Fawcett in his letter have been written about in many books of polar history.  It seems that the last of the three voyages, that of the Investigator, played the greatest role in the history of my family, however.  This is because Edward Fawcett’s future son-in-law, James Williams, was also on board this search vessel as Captain of the Hold<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>.   This time the commander was Robert McClure, who had been with Ross (and Fawcett) on their last voyage, and they approached the Arctic Circle from the West, via the Pacific and the Bering Strait. Another small find at home provided the key both to the family history and to my ancestors’ involvement at the time of a momentous event in the destiny of the expedition.  This find was of an old sepia picture, and it lived in the front of our family atlas. It shows a painting exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1870.  It is entitled ‘The Finding of H.M.S. Investigator, Captain McClure, RN, frozen up in Mercy Bay, Baring Island, the 6th April, 1853.’  Written in pencil is the following inscription:  Father and Grandfather were in this ship and were burying a shipmate in the ice when discovered by Lieutenant Pym and two other petty officers<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This was the occasion, when after 3 winters stuck fast in the ice, the crew of the Investigator were rescued, half-starving, and with a number suffering mental breakdowns. They had to abandon their ship and cross the frozen North-West Passage on foot, to link up with a ship that had been searching for Franklin from the East.  I recognise the handwriting of the inscription as that of my great grandfather, Robert Henry Williams, the second son of James Williams, and grandson of Edward Fawcett.  For the friendship between those two men (only 7 years apart in age) led to the subsequent marriage of James with Edward’s daughter, Priscilla, shortly after the two men got back to England on 7 October 1854.  This in turn led to the founding of a family that would move to the North Norfolk coast, where they would have descendants living for many generations to come.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> This was a position equivalent to Captain of the Forecastle.  The crew list shows that among the senior ratings on the Investigator there were Captains of the Hold, the Forecastle, the Fore-top and the Main-top. In the Scott Polar Institute there are the unpublished diaries of James Nelson, who was a young seaman in the Investigator, still in his late teens.  He had a certain gift for entertaining others with his poetry on special occasions such as the New Year.  One of his efforts is entitled “The Old Worn out Lanthorn in the possession of James Williams, Captain of the Hold, 1851-2-3”  In it he gently mocks the attempts of the Captain to protect his battered light from the blows it received from casks rolling about below deck.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> The fact that Edward and James were given this job suggests to me that they were among those who had been on increased rations for the previous few weeks, because they had been chosen as fit to abandon ship and make a desperate bid to escape south over the ice (rather as Franklin and his men had done … with disastrous results.)  Strictly speaking, they were digging a hole in the ice; the burial took place later. It took several more days to dig down to a depth of 4 feet.</p>
