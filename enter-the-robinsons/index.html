  <h2>Enter the Robinsons...</h2>

      <p>I am more interested in John Robinson, however, as he was to be <em>another</em> of my great great grandfathers (his daughter Mary married James Williams’ second son, Robert Henry.)  His father, Thomas, had been a carpenter in Chatham, so perhaps worked in the dockyard.  At any rate John, born 1820, went into the navy and saw service in the Mediterranean, a key area of foreign policy interest for Britain, with the Turkish Empire in decline, Russia ambitious, the land and sea routes to India at stake.  John transferred from the navy to the coastguard at the young age of 27<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup>.  Around then he must have married Catherine Groves, who was ten years younger, and who had been born in Freshwater in the Isle of Wight.  They went to Cromer for just one year.  He then transferred to Yarmouth, and it was while they were there that their first two, and for many years only, sons were born. Catherine seems to have had almost as many children as Priscilla, but the next 7 were all girls!  In 1851 John received promotion and was moved to Caister, just North of Yarmouth, but after a week in Caister, it appears that he requested to be moved to Winterton, another few miles north along the coast on in the direction of Cromer.  He had been there, as one of the two ‘Command boatmen’, for some 6 years by the time the Williams family arrived in 1857.</p>

<p>In the January of 1857 a young whale was washed on shore alive at Winterton.  It was one of the family of balaenopteridae, or rorquals, which includes the minkes, but it is not clear exactly which species it belonged to. The Rector, Revd. John Nelson, decided to record it inside the back cover of the Baptism Register, a strange choice. He records that its length was 42 feet. The Illustrated London News published a report of the stranded whale, and pronounced that it was 48 feet long.  Neither account describes what happened to the poor beast, but no doubt the carcase was divided by local people as another example of the bounty of the sea.</p>
