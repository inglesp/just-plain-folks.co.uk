  <h2>James Williams marries Priscilla Fawcett</h2>
</div>
      <p>The marriage between James and Priscilla took place at St.Nicholas, the parish church of Strood, at the mouth of the Medway in Kent.  The date was 2nd November 1854.  This was less than 4 weeks after Edward and James had returned from a voyage that had lasted 4 years!  All those who returned were lucky to have survived. Many bore frostbite injuries.  For a long while I believed that Priscilla was 18 when she got married, as this is consistent with the ages she gave to the census enumerators much later in her life.  Even allowing for the fact that Priscilla may have been older than 18 (she claimed to be 21 on their marriage certificate) or that she may have known James years earlier before the Investigator sailed: even allowing for the glamour which surrounded polar explorers in the mid-Victorian era, which may have made him a romantic hero-figure in her eyes, the wedding has an aura of extraordinary haste about it.  This seems to suggest that it may have been something of an arranged marriage, one hatched in the minds of weary sailors returning longingly to shore, looking forward to finding all the comforts of home.  After all, the later censuses suggest that James was probably 34 (although he claimed to be 31 on their marriage certificate.)  His ‘residence at the time of marriage’ was Taylor’s Lane Strood, an alleyway off the High Street, famous Watling Street, which crossed the river Medway a stone’s throw away.  This was the address of the Fawcett family, so James had apparently been taken under their roof on his return. Less than 4 weeks, however, is not even time enough for Priscilla to have discovered herself pregnant.  No; one can only assume that it was ‘a fact universally acknowledged’ that James was in need of a wife, and that Priscilla would do very nicely!</p>

<p>James’ own background is interesting. The 1861 census says he was born in British America.  The place given in the 1881 census is St. Johns  <span class="caps">NBN</span>, America, which the 1891 census confirms is Saint John, New Brunswick, in Canada.  James’ father, also James, (according to our James’ marriage certificate) was a victualler.  My Father believed he had Welsh roots on the coast of mid-Wales.  I imagined that perhaps James Williams Senior, was a seafarer who crossed the Atlantic and plied a trade in supplies to boats in the great seaport of Saint John, then sending his son to sea in his turn. But this great modern aid to the genealogist, the Internet, has provided other potential roots. It seems that James may have descended from a Dutch family, probably with Huguenot origins, called Guiliamse, later anglicised to Williams<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>. They were British Loyalists who fled north from New York at the time of the American Revolution, and settled in New Brunswick. Unfortunately it has not been possible to be sure that the James Williams whose career we are concerned with here is the same James as appears on the New Brunswick family tree.  But whatever his precise background, it is no wonder he had no other home to go back to when they docked in 1854!</p>
