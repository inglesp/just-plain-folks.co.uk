  <h2>The Robinsons move on</h2>
</div>
      <p>The Robinson children were spared.  Catherine, too, had been busy childbearing in the years since she arrived in Winterton.  Agnes was born in 1853, Rosanna in 1857, Sarah in 1858/9 and Mary in 1860.  A fifth girl, Alice, was born before the family moved from Winterton in 1863.  In the 1881 census, Sarah Popay, aged 69, who lived around the corner from the coastguard cottages, is recorded as midwife, the only one named as such in Winterton. 20 years earlier no occupation is named for her, and she just appears as a fisherman’s wife and mother of six children aged between 6 and 20.  But it is hard not to imagine that she was already delivering Winterton’s babies, and she may have been very used to making her way from Leaches Loke to the Coastguard Yard, also off Beach Road.  In February 1863, however, John received promotion again, this time to chief boatman, with a move to Southwold, further south on the Suffolk coast.</p>
<p>I have no way of proving that the Williams family and the Robinson family kept in touch, let alone of knowing how.  We could imagine them writing letters, exchanging news of the children, but could they write?  Neither James nor Priscilla had signed their own names on their marriage certificate, instead adding their mark or cross beside their names.  It seems from his letter to the Standard, that Edward Fawcett probably did read and write &#8211; perhaps James and Priscilla struggled to learn too, as many adults were doing at this time? They may both have been able to read, as it was not uncommon for children to attend schools where reading was on the curriculum (chiefly to enable the reading of the Bible) but writing was not. There were certainly reading classes held on the Investigator, when Edward and James were on board; it was one way of relieving the inevitable monotony when the ship was stuck in the ice. Whoever was responsible for their correspondence, they apparently kept in touch.  It would be good to imagine the two families meeting for days together on the beach at Yarmouth or Lowestoft, two seaside resorts which were beginning to open up to tourists and trippers. But neither Winterton nor Southwold had railway lines serving them, (or in the case of Winterton, nearby Hemsby,) until 1877 and 1879 respectively.  The only evidence that the two families maintained contact comes from the much later marriage between Robert Henry Williams and Mary Love Robinson &#8211; aged only 3 and 2 at  the time when their families moved apart.  But is it perhaps significant that Catherine named the first baby born to her in Southwold &#8211; yet another girl &#8211; as Priscilla?</p>
