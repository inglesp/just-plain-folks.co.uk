  <h2>Fleggisland</h2>
</div>
      <p>The ancient name of this division of Norfolk is Fleggisland.  It seems that this name derives from Old Norse ‘Flegg’ &#8211; and is an island where water plants, or flags, grow.  It is true that there is water all around. The River Thurne rises a little to the north of West Somerton and turns its back obstinately on the sea setting off instead in a circular route to join the River Bure, which finds the sea at Yarmouth, to the South.  And if that weren’t enough, the sea menaces, always looking for opportunities to make incursions into the land behind the dunes.  When the Williams family arrived, the great high tide two days after Christmas in 1791 may just have been within living memory.  Then the dunes were breached at Winterton, Horsey and Waxham, and the marshes behind flooded for many miles.</p>
<p>What did Priscilla make of Winterton?  There must have been many fewer newcomers there than in the busy Medway towns and of course among a much smaller population.  The same recurring surnames in the nineteenth century church records and censuses suggest a close-knit and inbred community:  King, George, Moll, Kettle, Haylett, Larner, Popay, Amis, Powles, Hodds, Goffin&#8230;.  the names are most plainly and visibly gathered together on the tombstones in the churchyard.  But there must have been something of a natural and ready-made community for the wife of a coastguard man to fit into, in the other families who inhabited the cottages of  the Coastguard Yard. For most of these families were also in comers. It had been the policy of the coastguard service to appoint men away from their own home area since the days when the apprehension of smugglers had been their main duty. So among those living in the Coast Guard Yard, according to the 1861 census, was William Paule, born in Flushing, Cornwall, Samuell Bishop, born in Gillingham, Kent (rather puzzlingly  his occupation is not given, and he does not seem to appear on the list of coastguards at  this date) and John Robinson, born in Chatham, also of course, in Kent.  The most senior of the coastguards, a ‘Chief boatman in charge’, was John Bungard, who was born in Sussex. He had arrived in 1856, aged 57, and his address, last after those of the occupants of Coast Guard Yard, is recorded as the Watch House.  The birthplaces of his children (now in their 20s and 30: the two girls were dressmakers, and the son recorded as a draper) show that he had seen earlier service in Weymouth, Dorset, and on the Suffolk coast.</p>
