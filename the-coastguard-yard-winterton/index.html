  <h2>The Coastguard Yard, Winterton</h2>
</div>
      <p>Many coastguards entered the service from the Royal Navy.  It must have been an ideal move for a man who wanted to live on shore with a family.  Coastguard Stations were equipped with living quarters for married men, and the standard of the housing seems to have been very good for its time. Parliamentary Papers in the National Archives<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> describe cottages with between 3 and 6 rooms, store rooms and outbuildings.  Notes on individual stations contain comments with a barely-concealed note of pride such as ‘a thorough system of drainage and water supply provided’, ‘an arrangement for a constant water supply and a complete system of drainage’, ‘forming and gravelling the quadrangle and making up footways’. Cottages seem to have cost in the region of £150 and £300 apiece.  They were also furnished.  A letter loose in the front of the Coastguard Register England and Scotland 1856 entitled General Memo no. 4 states “The articles for Buildings consist of the whole of the furniture allowed viz: Bedsteads, Tables, Chairs, Forms, Stools, Desks, Fenders, Fire Irons, Coal Boxes, Tanks, Water Butts and taps for the same, Casks on Wheels, and …(something which I could not decipher, but which looked like Arm Stands.)”  Other articles such as Ladder and Wheelbarrow could be ‘demanded specially’.  The memo is signed by Charles Eden, Comptroller General and sent to ‘The respective Inspecting Commanders and Officers in command of Districts’.  The address of the Winterton coastguard cottages which the Williams family moved to is given in the 1851 census as Coastguard yard, but in the 1881 census it is Barrack yard, for by this time new coastguard cottages had been built a little further from the beach.  Maps of the period show the original cottages to have been built in an ‘L’ shape facing generally out to sea. They are on the coastal edge of the village, although due to the way that the land falls away inland I think you would only have been able to see the sea over the dunes from an upstairs window, if indeed there were one. Unfortunately I have found no detailed plan of these cottages, and I believe they were demolished some time after the Second World War.</p>

<div id="caption">Winterton as it was at the beginning of the 20th century.  The Barrack Yard is due west of the coastguard Watch House on the dunes, a little to the north of King&#8217;s Corner. The Coastguard Station shown on the map is the fine new row of slate-roofed houses built in the 1870s and still there today.  There is an anchor at the top of the down pipes on these!</div>
<p>So in March 1857 James, Priscilla and their 9 month old baby set off for Winterton.  After the bustle of the Medway Towns, it must have seemed like one of the ends of the earth, at least to Priscilla. She had probably lived all her life  in and around the busy High Street of Strood, for she was born in the house of her Grandfather, Henry Johnson, who was a horse dealer there, and she seems to have moved no further afield than Taylors Lane after her parents’ marriage.  Of course her new husband, James, really had been to the ends of the earth, travelling far north of the Arctic Circle via the Bering Straits, having sailed there in the Investigator around Cape Horn (the Panama Canal not yet being dug.)</p>
<p>I guess that they travelled by train, from Strood to London Bridge, and then from Liverpool Street to Yarmouth.  What would they have taken? Perhaps only clothes and some household linens.  Packed in a sea chest or two?</p>
<p>What did they find at the end of that journey?  In his History, Gazetteer and Directory of Norfolk, of 1845, William White describes Winterton as</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;.an ancient fishing village, lying in a bay, 8 miles N. by W. of Yarmouth, and sheltered in the north-east by that bold promontory called Winterton Ness, well known to the mariner as the most fatal headland between Scotland and London.</strong><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>At one time Winterton had boasted ‘a market, fair and races,’ but by the 19th century these were only dimly remembered &#8211; for example in the name of North Market Road.  There were a number of shops however, and it was not far to the larger village of Martham, where there were more.  Before you came to Martham however, you must pass through Somerton (East and West) the settlements whose name reflects the dual origins of the villages whose inhabitants made a living by farming in the summer, before taking their boats out to fish from Winterton in the winter months.</p>
<p>The population of Winterton stood at between 700 and 800 during the middle decades of the 19th century. This included about 150 fishermen and their families.  The rest of the population were largely the families of farm labourers, with a scattering of bricklayers, corn millers, shoemakers and shopkeepers. There was a church, a windmill, a lighthouse, a school, and one or two larger properties. Daniel Defoe, in his Tour of England and Wales, written over a century before the Williams family came to the village, claimed that there was plenty of evidence in local buildings of the dangerous nature of the coast:  <br />
<strong>I was surprised to see&#8230;that the farmers and country people had scarce a barn, or a shed, or a stable; nay, not the pales of their yards, and gardens, not a hogsstye, not a necessary-house, but what was  built of old planks, beams, wales and timbers, &amp; the wrecks of ships, and ruins of mariners and merchants’ fortunes; and in some places were whole yards  fill’d and piled up very high with the same stuff laid up, as I suppos’d to sell  for the like building purposes, as there should be occasion.</strong></p>
<p>There were also two beach companies in Winterton, with perhaps 60 or 70 fishermen holding shares in them.  Such companies existed in most of the coastal towns and villages between Cromer and Aldborough. They were organised to provide all sorts of services to passing shipping, and played a major role in the rescue of ships in distress, often manning the lifeboats.  Their chief business was with salvage, however, and this is how they helped make a living for their members<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The coast here is wild and windswept, bleak and barren in the winter months.  The sand is pale and fine; flintish pebbles, irregular in size and shape, lie in banks where the sea has flung them. The sea itself, except under the bluest of skies, is pewter grey and restless, the prevailing currents sweeping from north to south.  At low tide sandbanks emerge, like long, flat islands, leaving shallow lagoons on their landward side The tide has left its patterns of ripples and grooves in the damp sand, the imprints of a thousand retreating waves.  Below the surface other sandbanks lie parallel to the coast, waiting for hapless boats to founder on them.</p>
<p>The beach in the mid-nineteenth century was busy with longshore fishing boats and the yawls used by the beach companies.  Above the beach were the soft crumbly cliffs, and behind them an area of dunes and marram grass, intersected with hundreds of narrow paths leading back to the village, or further along the coast. There were many wooden sheds here and the distinctive lookouts built by the beach companies, with their huts perched perilously high on stilts, with wooden ladders ascending them. This area was a crowded workplace, a man’s world for tough men.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn14"><sup>14</sup> David Higgins <em>The Beachmen</em> published Terence Dalton, 1987 gives a brilliant picture of the life of the beachmen.  They clearly outnumbered the coastguard 10:1 in Winterton, and there must have been times when their contrasting outlooks led to suspicion or even conflict: the first fiercely local, self-reliant, profit-driven; the second incomers, with a secure financial income (and pension!), government-imposed, with an implicit brief to defend the law of the property owner.  There is much evidence of their co-operation in life-saving episodes however, many of which are related in <em>Saved from the Sea</em> by Robert Malster published Terence Dalton 1974. Relations between the two groups might make a very interesting study, but is outside the scope of this book!</p>
