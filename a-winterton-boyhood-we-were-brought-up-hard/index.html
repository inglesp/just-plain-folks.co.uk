  <h2>A Winterton boyhood: "We were brought up hard"</h2>
</div>
      <p>In order to describe the childhood of those many children who did survive in this period, it is necessary to call on the memories of Sam Larner once again.  He recollects many big families of 8 or 9 children: “You could count 50 children in the street I was born.”  His own family all slept in 2 upstairs rooms.  When asked about privacy, he said that they “didn’t pay any heed to it.” There was one big room downstairs, with the red and yellow brick floors scrubbed clean each Saturday morning with sand.  As a boy Sam would often be sent down to the beach for a bag of sand: “You’d go like lightning for a farthing of sweets.” Food was never plentiful. Sam’s Mother baked 8 or 9 loaves every 2 or 3 days, and bread, butter and cheese were staples. As for herring: “We were brought up on ‘em, and I still love them.”  On a winter’s night, at 5.30. “You’d smell the herring a’cooking all over Winterton. Lovely smell.  They’d make yer mouth water.”  Modern nutritionists might put the survival of so many children down to the health benefits of sweet fresh herring.</p>
<p>Sam would also earn a “hatful of coppers” for singing to the charabancs that now made regular trips with holidaymakers from Yarmouth.  The songs he would sing were ones that he learnt at school, along with arithmetic (“just ordinary sums”) and poetry. He could still recite much of this 75 years later. Sam liked school, but also used to “play the truant.”  Amusements out of school included playing “ducks and drakes” on the beach (skimming stones across the water), games of rounders, marbles, playing with the iron hoops taken from tar barrels, making popguns out of elder and smoking “hedge bacca” which burned the tongue.  He claimed to have been smoking from 7 or 8, using the claws of crabs for pipes, stealing tobacco from his Father and hiding his pipe under the water butt.  There were territorial disputes between the children who lived in the ‘Top village’ round King Street where Sam lived, and ‘Down the village’, which probably included the Barrack Yard.</p>
<p>Most gratifying to me, however, are Sam’s memories of the “gruff old man with a stick” who “used to tell us all yarns in the Reading Room.”  This “old boy” was “Ned Fawcett” who had gone to search for Franklin and survived the 1860 May Gale. He is one of only a handful of inhabitants of Winterton that Sam identifies by name.  Ned used to tell the boys how, when he’d been trapped in the polar ice “many a time I’ve killed a bear and sucked his blood.” Also, of how “you could hear the ice a-squeezin’ the ship” and&#8230; greatest hardship of all?&#8230; of how “Sam, my boy, we left half a ton of bacca on that ship” &#8211; when they had had to abandon the Investigator to make their escape!  It seems that the Reading Room (which I’m told was near to the Barrack Yard) was looked after by the old man’s son-in-law &#8230; so James Williams, in retirement!  Reading Rooms were a common feature of ports and fishing places, as they provided an alternative to the pub for seamen who just wanted to meet, play games and read the papers.  As such they were sometimes founded by religious bodies, or &#8211; as in Winterton &#8211; built by voluntary subscriptions.  The Reading Room along the coast in Southwold survives to this day.</p>
<p>So Sam Larner has provided me not only with a picture of family and fishing life in the last two decades of the century, but has revealed a little more of my own family history!</p>
