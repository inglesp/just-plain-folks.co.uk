  <h2>Antecedents: the extraordinary career of Edward Fawcett</h2>
</div>
      <p>This story begins with an oil painting which lived in the lofts of our family homes, seeing the light of day only when we moved.  It was far too big to hang on the walls, and much too dark to suit modern tastes.  I think we also thought it very ugly. All I knew was that it showed my Grandad Williams, born in 1893, as a baby, and that he was sitting on the lap of his own great grandfather. This great grandfather was Edward Fawcett, and I was told that he had been an explorer.</p>

<div id="caption">It was clearly important to have a painting of young Robert George with his great grandfather!</div>
<p>Many years passed before I had the curiosity to discover more.  In the meantime my grandfather died, as did my grandmother (who could have told me the stories,) and my father (who would have heard them when he was young.)  Dad left a book called ‘The Search for Franklin,’<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>  and tucked into the front of this I found a small yellowing scrap of newsprint from which much of the background to this story comes. It is dated August 2nd 1895, and is addressed <strong>“To the Editor of the Standard” from Edward Fawcett, Pensioner RN, Winterton, Norfolk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sir &#8211; Seeing the statement in The Standard of July 30 that Sir Joseph Hooker was the only survivor of Sir James Ross’s Antarctic Expedition, I wish to point out that Sir Joseph is not the last or only survivor, as I was on that Expedition as captain of the forecastle of the Erebus, and was always of Dr. McCormick’s party when he was ashore botanising.  And I was with Sir James on the 1st Franklin Search Expedition, and accompanied that Commander on his land journeys; was boatswain’s mate in the Investigator, with Captain McClure, and made the NW passage.  I am now in my 83rd year of age, hale and hearty, except a little shaky on my “pins.”  I am, Sir, your obedient servant&#8230;&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Most of this meant very little to me, although I now realise it contains enough information to hint at a life of dramatic adventures in the regions of both Poles.  As captain of the forecastle and boatswain’s mate my three greats grandfather was only a naval rating, but clearly he had some authority over the men on board, and would have been well known to the officers<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.  He would have been paid half as much again as an ordinary seaman. He is not afraid to claim his rightful position as one of the survivors of a pioneering Antarctic voyage of 1839-43, along with its very famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Hooker, confidante of Charles Darwin and Director of Kew Gardens from 1865. Not bad for the son of Zachariah Fawcett and his wife Sally, a Medway fishing family!</p>
<p>Sir James Ross’s Antarctic Expedition was charged with finding the south magnetic pole (he had already located the north magnetic pole in 1831.)  He had two ships called the Erebus and the Terror.  Both were former warships, now specially strengthened for the rigours of the voyage ahead. He himself captained the Erebus.  Robert McCormick (a Yarmouth man) was surgeon and naturalist on that ship, while Joseph Hooker (to his great disappointment) was only assistant surgeon and botanist.  Fortunately the two naturalists got on well and Hooker was able to do all the investigative work ashore that he wanted.  His opinion of McCormick was not very high however: “He takes no interest, but in bird shooting and rock collecting.”<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>  But we have Edward Fawcett’s testimony that he did do some ‘botanising’ as well!</p>
<p>The expedition spent 3 summers exploring and charting the Antarctic.  They named islands, mountains and coasts, many previously unknown.  A smoking volcano was named Mount Erebus, while its dormant neighbour became Mount Terror.  There were other excitements.  On one occasion sailing towards Cape Horn in the darkness, they encountered a massive iceberg, and in their desperation to escape, the two vessels collided, their masts becoming entangled so that either might have been dragged under.  On New Years Day 1842 both ships anchored in thick foggy weather, about 50 yards apart, on an iceberg.  They set about carving out a ballroom and an inn, which became the scenes of much revelling and seasonal fun, from dancing and snowball fights to sack races.  There were contests to catch a hapless pig and to climb a greasy pole<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>.   What stories to return home with after four and a half years away!  Would his young wife and daughter be able to take it all in?</p>
<p>The other two voyages north of the Arctic Circle were part of the frantic search for Captain Sir John Franklin, whose disappearance while searching for the elusive North-West Passage, was a mystery which gripped the public imagination in the late 1840s and 1850s. Sir James Ross was an obvious choice to mount a search as he had so much Arctic experience himself.  Also, Franklin had taken the Erebus and Terror as his ships, and Ross’ good friend, Francis Crozier, who had commanded the Terror in the southern hemisphere, was Franklin’s second in command.  Ross sailed for the Arctic in April 1848 with an experienced crew drawn from his previous expeditions.  Among them was Edward Fawcett.  This voyage was altogether shorter than the Antarctic expedition, lasting only 18 months.  One of the land journeys referred to in the newspaper cutting was presumably the 40 day sledge journey round North Somerset Island which covered over 500 miles.  The sledges were hauled by men rather than dogs, but Ross had incorporated Inuit ideas in their design, which was used by the navy for many years to come.  The men were in a poor state on their return however, and in the end ice conditions meant that the entire trip had to be abandoned, with no news of Franklin’s fate. The men suffered badly from scurvy on the voyage home, but there was much ignorant criticism as they got back, that they had not continued their search for longer</p>
